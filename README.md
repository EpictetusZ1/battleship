# BattleShip 

### Play the classic game BattleShip against a computer!

An assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to learn and practice:
- Jest Testing framework
- TDD or Test Driven Development

### Things I learned:
- Agile development principles using TDD
- Red, Green, Refactor
- Loose Coupling of objects/ modules
- Representing complex game states and preforming Create Read and Update operations on them


### Functionality:
- Ability to place ships
- Alert user to Hit and Miss state for each coordinate they click on, for both the computer and user boards.
- Alert user when board is in a ready state.
- Alert user when game is over and who has won.

### About: 
- Board is represented by a 2-dimensional Array. 
  - This allows the game board to be represented and accessed by a Cartesian coordinate system, both for the user and computer.
